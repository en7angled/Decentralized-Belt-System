# Build and test after implementing a plan

**Task** here means the implementation of a plan (e.g. a multi-step plan or checklist). After each such task — or after each major step of the plan — ensure the project builds and tests pass before considering the work done or moving to the next step.

## Requirement

1. From repo root, run **`cabal build all`** then **`cabal test`**.
2. If either fails, fix the failures before proceeding.
3. Do not treat the implementation as complete, and do not start the next task or step, until both succeed.

For the exact commands and test layout, see [testing-and-config.mdc](testing-and-config.mdc). For build/test environment (e.g. `CABAL_DIR`), see [environment.mdc](../environment.mdc).
