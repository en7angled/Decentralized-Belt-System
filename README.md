## 1. Overview

The **Decentralized Belt System** aims to bring **transparency** and **trust** to the Brazilian Jiu Jitsu rank promotion process by recording practitioner profiles, belt lineages, and achievements on the **Cardano** blockchain. This approach eliminates reliance on siloed or inconsistent records, ensuring that every belt rank is **verifiable** by anyone in the community.

---

## 2. Key Features

- **Immutable Rank Tracking**: Every rank promotion is recorded on-chain along with the awarding authority.  
- **Ensure transparency** in rank progression and lineage  
- **Achievements & Memberships**: Practitioners can showcase achievements, and organizational memberships in one place.
